Setting up project, added SCSS

8 Oct 2019
Added SCSS compiler + filter to minify CSS: improved the way SCSS is handled. Now it takes up all of SCSS files and bundles it into one minified CSS file

Custom error pages: I don't want the website to display default error page to user + I want to implement better error handling in future so when a user gets error, I want to get email about it.
